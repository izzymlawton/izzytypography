  <h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Isabel Margaret Lawton, but most people just call me Izzy. I am 19, go by she/her pronouns and I am currently studying ‘media journalism and publishing’ at <a href=https://www.brookes.ac.uk>Oxford Brookes.</a> 
</p>

<p>My favourite animal is a frog and I have a hyper affectionate dog called Dewi, who’s back in <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shropshire/@52.6523311,-2.7342319,9z/data>Shropshire</a>, where I am from.</p>

  <h2>Who?</h2>


<p>I love art and I am passionate about mythology, creative writing and bringing people together through the use of activities and passions, and I know that things like art or sport can do just that. For example, I used to be a teaching assistant for a children’s art class and coach their netball team. Seeing people use their art and sport to not only express themselves but also to work together shows just this. </p>

<H2>Why?</H2>
<p>I have found that Publishing helps bring people together by making the works of others available to the public, creating communities/fanbases of people, and can inspire and motivate people to create their own works, creating a circle of creativity.</p> 
<p>This can be done throught the use of...</p>
<ul>
  <li>fictional/non fiction books</li>
  <li>magazines</li>
  <li>even posters for films or shows</li>
</ul>
<p>Winning a bronze medal for creative writinig in the <a href= http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk >Wenlock Olympia Games </a>is one of the times this ideology was solidified for me. </p>

  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    Inspiration is one of the most important tools for creating. One example of the books that have inspired me is the 'Percy Jackson' series by Rick Riordan.</p>
    <p>The Percy Jackson series inspires me becuase of the community it has created, not to mention the way Rick Riordan's characters and storylines are so incuslive, having people of differnet religions, ethnicities and sexualities. Making it so that any reader can see themselves in a character. </p>

      <h2>Inspirational women</h2>
<p>People are also a massive part of where creators can draw their inspiration and motivation. Some of the people that have been this to me are...</p>
<h3>Emma Watson</h3>

<p><a href=https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson>Emma Watson</a> has been an inspiration to me ever since her role as Hermione in the Harry Potter films, She helps inspire many young girls by protraying strong intelligence women like Hermione, Belle (beauty and the beast) and Meg (little women).</p>
<p>She has also been a great advocate for feminism, most notably for her speech at the 'HeforShe' Campaign in 2014.</p>
<h3>Jameela Jamil</h3>
