<h1>About me: <span>Isabel Lawton</span></h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Isabel Margaret Lawton, but most people just call me Izzy. I am 19, go by she/her pronouns and I am currently studying ‘media journalism and publishing’ at <a href=https://www.brookes.ac.uk>Oxford Brookes.</a> 
</p>

<p>My favourite animal is a frog and I have a hyper affectionate dog called Dewi, who’s back in Shropshire, where I am from.</p>

<p>I love art and I am passionate about mythology, creative writing and bringing people together through the use of activities and passions, and I know that thing like art or sport can do just that. For example, I used to be a teaching assistant for a children’s art class and netball team. </p>

<p>Publishing helps do that by making the works of others available to the public, which can inspire and motivate people to create their own works, creating a circle of creativity. This can be done throught the use of...</p>
<ul>
  <li>fictional/non fiction books</li>
  <li>magazines</li>
  <li>even posters for films or shows</li>
</ul>
