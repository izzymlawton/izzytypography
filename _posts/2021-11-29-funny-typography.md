**funny typography take 1: Action!**

Typography should be able to instil humour into audiences, to purvey what kind of humour the comedy is and the general tone of the movie. 

## Bad Teacher

The typography in Bad Teacher shows the theme of the show immediately with the title being written in chalk, with smudges all around it, showing the characters uncaring attitude. It also has the word 'bad' in all capitals with a monospaced bold look with a thick type of font, drawing empathises towards that she is a 'bad' teacher. This is also helped with the word 'teacher' keeping the same all capitals tone but is now a lot more handwritten with the cap heights being slightly different on each letter creating a haphazard appearance, portraying the character as not being passionate about being a teacher.

The handwritten effect is ongoing throughout the poster with a subheading showing a handwritten note of 'eat me' on an apple, again playing in the role of teacher, but the use of wording and the exclamation mark after empathising to the bad side. this plays in humour as teachers are stereotypically meant to be neat and caring, so already the typography is playing against that.
