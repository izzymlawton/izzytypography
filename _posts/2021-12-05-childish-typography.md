Typography should grab your attention and memorable ones should stay with you. Creating magic for children's imaginations. 

## Tangled

The magical land of princesses that is Disney needs to match the iconic brand. This typography uses a classic serif font and a gold metallic colour to symbolise the royalty and princess stature of Rapunzel. It also uses the dramatic flick of the 'G' to mirror her hair, (which is a major theme of the movie). This also represents the time period the film was based in as dramatic loops and serif handwritten fonts were the handwriting of the monks (who were some of the only people who had the ability to write).

However, along with the elegancy of the typeface, there is also a roughness and a worn look to the typography, using a slight dark outline and dark patches to the gold lettering to mirror the other main character that's a thief and not royalty. It also shows that the princess didn't grow up royal and instead was kept in a worn tower and matches her adventures nature because it purveys use and wears instead of being pristine. Almost like how an old treasure map would look.

## Finding Nemo
