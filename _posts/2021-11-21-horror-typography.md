Horror typography take 1: Action!

## Trick 'r Treat

Trick 'r treat provokes this by using handwritten looking typography, this with the missing 'o' to abbreviate 'or' gives it a childish effective, like if it was a child that had craved it; which is appropriate as the movie focuses on one child in particular (Sam \[pictured on the poster]). The chaotic and random aspects of the typography are commonly used in scary movies posters, as it can make it more creepy to the audience, as when you look closer nothing is what it seems. For example the random changes to Capitals to small caps like the 'A' in 'treat', and the differences in 'X' heights and baselines between the letters. The most noticeable creepy aspect of the typography is the use of colour and the 3D effect of the title to make it look like it is on fire or has been written using fire, this goes with the movie as the main character is dressed as a jackal lantern, which normally has fire within, with the colours complimenting and matching the rest of the poster making it all connecting with the offset shadows.
